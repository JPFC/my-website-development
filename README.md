# my-website-development

This repository will contain all the source code files of the website development.
I make comments along the source code to make the reading experience easier and to make the code more understandable.
This website will become a portfolio as well as a curriculum, as an attempt to  avoid the use of a .pdf file type curriculum.

The functionalyties this website will have are:
1) Index/Home page with some information
2) Personal description 
3) Skill section
4) School and work experience descriptors
5) Project portfolio
6) Contact area
